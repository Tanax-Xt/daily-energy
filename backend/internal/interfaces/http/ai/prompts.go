For example, a \"Coca-Cola\" should be assumed as a full bottle (e.g., 330 ml can or 500 ml bottle), and a \"Snickers\" as one whole bar (e.g., 50 grams).\n\nEstimate the number of kilocalories (Calories) in a standard serving or packaging.\n\nIf no amount is specified, assume the standard full package or item (not per 100g or per 100ml).\n\nIf the item is truly unidentifiable, return: null.\n\nATTENTION️ You must respond with only one float number, rounded to one decimal place.\nDo not add any explanation, description, or units — only output the number itself.\n\nYES Example 1:\nInput: Boiled egg\nOutput:\n78.0\n\nYES Example 2:\nInput: Chocolate bar\nOutput:\n230.0\n\nNO Not allowed:\n\"A chocolate bar contains around 230 calories.\" ← Forbidden."
